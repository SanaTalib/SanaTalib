Hi Github bees, 

Welcome to my Github Profile.

This is Sana Talib. I have a degree in Data Science which makes it worth it by showing my interest through different projects in the field. 

I'm interested in coming up with innovative ideas, experimenting with programming and learning it much better. 

I'm currently learning Deep Learning Tools Tensorflow, PyTorch and Keras.

Side wise I am also looking to explore the functionalities of developing a backend of a software or application.

Check out my projects might be helpful.

Wishing you good luck for your achievements!

Best Regards, 
Sana Talib
